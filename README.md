# CREATE2 and CREATE 

This repo demonstrates the difference between CREATE and CREATE2 opcodes.
And the second script shows how the nonce increases of a contract address.

You can simply run the test or script to see how CREATE2 allows you to deploy a contract at precomputed address. 

To check the nonce increment, you can run the script `nonce.js`
